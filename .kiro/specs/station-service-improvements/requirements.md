# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses code quality and robustness issues identified in the StationService.kt implementation. The current service has several areas for improvement including generic exception handling, hardcoded values, missing input validation, and redundant operations. This enhancement will improve error handling, configurability, validation, and overall maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific custom exceptions for different error scenarios, so that I can handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful HTTP status codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a station is not found THEN the system SHALL throw StationNotFoundException instead of generic RuntimeException
2. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL throw ValidationException with specific details
3. WHEN a station already exists with the same identifier THEN the system SHALL throw StationAlreadyExistsException
4. WHEN custom exceptions are thrown THEN they SHALL include meaningful error messages and context
5. WHEN exceptions are handled THEN they SHALL map to appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable station ID generation and status values, so that I can adapt the system to different deployment requirements without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new station is created THEN the ID prefix SHALL be configurable via application properties
2. WHEN station status is set THEN default status values SHALL be defined as enums
3. WHEN ID generation occurs THEN the strategy SHALL be configurable (UUID, sequential, custom)
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL use new values without code deployment
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use secure defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input validation on station DTOs, so that invalid data is rejected before processing and clear validation errors are returned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CreateStationDto is processed THEN all required fields SHALL be validated
2. WHEN UpdateStationDto is processed THEN all provided fields SHALL be validated
3. WHEN station name is provided THEN it SHALL not be blank and have reasonable length limits
4. WHEN coordinates are provided THEN they SHALL be within valid latitude/longitude ranges
5. WHEN validation fails THEN specific field-level error messages SHALL be returned

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database operations, so that the system performs efficiently and follows Spring Data JPA best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting a station THEN redundant existence checks SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN station operations occur THEN they SHALL use appropriate Spring Data JPA patterns
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with meaningful messages
4. WHEN bulk operations are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented efficiently
5. WHEN transactions are used THEN they SHALL be properly scoped and configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved service architecture, so that the code is more maintainable, testable, and follows SOLID principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods are implemented THEN they SHALL have single responsibilities
2. WHEN dependencies are injected THEN they SHALL use interfaces where appropriate
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be separated from data access concerns
4. WHEN the service is tested THEN it SHALL be easily mockable and testable
5. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing architecture

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track station operations and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN station operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate levels
2. WHEN errors happen THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN they SHALL be available through monitoring
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN station changes SHALL be trackable
5. WHEN log analysis is performed THEN logs SHALL contain structured, searchable information
