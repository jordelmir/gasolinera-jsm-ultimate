# Requirements Document - Complete App Functionality

## Introduction

Este spec define los requisitos para completar la funcionalidad de la aplicaci칩n Gasolinera JSM Ultimate, transform치ndola de un estado parcialmente funcional a una aplicaci칩n completamente operativa y lista para producci칩n.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Backend Services

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all backend services to be fully functional and integrated, so that the application can handle all business operations end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all 5 core services (auth, coupon, station, raffle, redemption) SHALL be running and healthy
2. WHEN a service receives a request THEN it SHALL respond within 2 seconds for 95% of requests
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use the internal SDK for consistent data exchange
4. IF a service fails THEN the API Gateway SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent users

### Requirement 2: Complete API Gateway Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a single API endpoint that routes to all services, so that I can build a cohesive user interface without managing multiple service endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to /api/\* THEN the gateway SHALL route it to the appropriate service
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the gateway SHALL validate JWT tokens before forwarding requests
3. WHEN a service is unavailable THEN the gateway SHALL return appropriate fallback responses
4. WHEN requests are made THEN the gateway SHALL add correlation IDs for tracing
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the gateway SHALL return 429 status codes

### Requirement 3: Complete Database Schema and Data Flow

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all data to be properly stored and retrievable, so that the system maintains data integrity and provides accurate reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all database tables SHALL be created with proper relationships
2. WHEN data is created THEN it SHALL be validated according to business rules
3. WHEN data is queried THEN it SHALL return consistent results across services
4. WHEN transactions occur THEN they SHALL maintain ACID properties
5. WHEN the system scales THEN database queries SHALL remain performant

### Requirement 4: Complete Frontend-Backend Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the web interface to display real data and allow me to perform all business operations, so that I can manage the gas station system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN it SHALL display real-time data from backend services
2. WHEN I create a station THEN it SHALL be saved to the database and appear in the list
3. WHEN I generate a coupon THEN it SHALL create a valid QR code that can be redeemed
4. WHEN I view analytics THEN it SHALL show accurate metrics from the system
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the UI SHALL display meaningful error messages

### Requirement 5: Complete Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all endpoints to be properly secured and authenticated, so that only authorized users can access system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected endpoints THEN users SHALL provide valid JWT tokens
2. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401/403 status codes
4. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit
5. WHEN audit logs are needed THEN all operations SHALL be logged with user context

### Requirement 6: Complete Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests to ensure system reliability, so that we can deploy with confidence and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN unit tests SHALL achieve at least 80% coverage
2. WHEN services interact THEN integration tests SHALL verify correct behavior
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN end-to-end tests SHALL validate user workflows
4. WHEN performance is tested THEN the system SHALL meet defined SLA requirements
5. WHEN security is tested THEN no critical vulnerabilities SHALL be present

### Requirement 7: Complete Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be production-ready with proper monitoring and deployment capabilities, so that it can be reliably operated in a live environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for all services
2. WHEN metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
3. WHEN logs are required THEN all services SHALL use structured logging
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL use containerized deployment with Docker
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN services SHALL be horizontally scalable
