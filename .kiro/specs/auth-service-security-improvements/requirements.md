# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the AuthService.kt implementation. The current OTP authentication system has several security weaknesses that need to be resolved to ensure the safety and integrity of user accounts. This includes implementing cryptographically secure OTP generation, brute-force protection, proper validation, token revocation mechanisms, and secure logging practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system administrator, I want OTPs to be generated using cryptographically secure methods, so that they cannot be predicted or compromised by attackers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL use java.security.SecureRandom instead of kotlin.random.Random
2. WHEN an OTP is created THEN it SHALL be cryptographically unpredictable and meet security standards
3. WHEN the OTP generation process runs THEN it SHALL not use any predictable seed values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want protection against brute-force attacks on OTP verification, so that user accounts remain secure from unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fails OTP verification 5 times for the same phone number THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock that phone number from further attempts
2. WHEN an OTP verification attempt is made THEN the system SHALL track and increment the failure count for that phone number
3. WHEN a successful OTP verification occurs THEN the system SHALL reset the failure count for that phone number
4. WHEN an OTP is successfully verified THEN it SHALL be marked as used and cannot be reused
5. WHEN a locked phone number attempts OTP verification THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper phone number validation, so that only valid phone numbers can receive OTPs and system errors are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a phone number is provided for OTP generation THEN the system SHALL validate it follows a proper format
2. WHEN an invalid phone number format is detected THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
3. WHEN phone number validation occurs THEN it SHALL support international and local Costa Rican formats
4. WHEN a phone number passes validation THEN it SHALL be normalized to a consistent format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the ability to revoke JWT tokens immediately, so that compromised tokens can be invalidated before their natural expiration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JWT token is issued THEN it SHALL be tracked in a token registry
2. WHEN a token revocation is requested THEN the system SHALL add the token to a blacklist
3. WHEN a blacklisted token is used for authentication THEN the system SHALL reject it as invalid
4. WHEN tokens expire naturally THEN they SHALL be automatically removed from the tracking system
5. WHEN the system validates a token THEN it SHALL check both signature validity and blacklist status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want sensitive information removed from logs, so that user data and security credentials are not exposed in log files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OTP operations are logged THEN phone numbers SHALL not appear in log messages
2. WHEN OTP operations are logged THEN actual OTP codes SHALL not appear in log messages
3. WHEN authentication events are logged THEN only non-sensitive identifiers SHALL be included
4. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN it SHALL still not expose sensitive user data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OTP configuration to be externalized, so that I can adjust timing and security parameters without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN OTP expiration time SHALL be read from application.yml configuration
2. WHEN OTP rate limiting is configured THEN lockout duration SHALL be configurable via application.yml
3. WHEN OTP settings are changed in configuration THEN they SHALL take effect without code deployment
4. WHEN configuration values are missing THEN the system SHALL use secure default values
5. WHEN invalid configuration values are provided THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use defaults

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging for authentication events, so that security incidents can be investigated and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OTP is generated THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp and non-sensitive identifiers
2. WHEN OTP verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure with attempt count
3. WHEN an account is locked due to failed attempts THEN the system SHALL log the security event
4. WHEN a JWT token is revoked THEN the system SHALL log the revocation event
5. WHEN authentication events are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient detail for security monitoring
