# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines a comprehensive system-wide architecture review and improvement initiative for the Gasolinera JSM platform. The goal is to systematically analyze and enhance the entire codebase across all services, applications, and infrastructure components to improve scalability, security, performance, maintainability, and developer experience. This initiative will employ a multi-agent approach with specialized roles to ensure thorough coverage of all architectural concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want a comprehensive analysis of the entire system architecture, so that I can identify scalability bottlenecks, modularity issues, and design pattern violations across all services and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the architecture review is initiated THEN the system SHALL analyze all backend services (api-gateway, auth-service, station-service, coupon-service, redemption-service, ad-engine, raffle-service)
2. WHEN analyzing each service THEN the system SHALL evaluate dependency management, service boundaries, and inter-service communication patterns
3. WHEN reviewing frontend applications THEN the system SHALL assess component architecture, state management, and code organization patterns
4. WHEN examining the monorepo structure THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for better modularity and shared code optimization
5. WHEN analyzing infrastructure code THEN the system SHALL review Docker configurations, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security expert, I want to identify and remediate all security vulnerabilities and authentication/authorization weaknesses, so that the platform meets enterprise security standards and protects user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting security analysis THEN the system SHALL scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities across all services
2. WHEN reviewing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL validate JWT implementation, token management, and session security
3. WHEN examining data handling THEN the system SHALL identify potential sensitive data exposure in logs, APIs, and database queries
4. WHEN analyzing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify proper authorization checks and input validation
5. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
6. IF security vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation recommendations following OWASP guidelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks and code inefficiencies, so that the system can handle increased load and provide better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing backend services THEN the system SHALL identify slow database queries, inefficient algorithms, and memory leaks
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL detect N+1 query problems and unnecessary data fetching
3. WHEN examining frontend applications THEN the system SHALL identify bundle size issues, unnecessary re-renders, and slow components
4. WHEN analyzing data flow THEN the system SHALL detect redundant processing and opportunities for caching
5. WHEN reviewing resource usage THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities to reduce memory consumption and CPU usage
6. IF performance issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations with expected impact

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to improve code maintainability, readability, and developer experience, so that the team can work more efficiently and onboard new developers faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code quality THEN the system SHALL assess consistency of coding standards across TypeScript, Kotlin, and configuration files
2. WHEN analyzing type safety THEN the system SHALL identify missing type definitions and opportunities for stronger typing
3. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL evaluate API documentation, README files, and inline code comments
4. WHEN reviewing test coverage THEN the system SHALL assess unit test quality, integration test completeness, and e2e test effectiveness
5. WHEN analyzing developer tooling THEN the system SHALL evaluate build processes, linting rules, and development workflows
6. IF maintainability issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project coordinator, I want a prioritized improvement plan based on all analysis findings, so that I can allocate resources effectively and maximize the impact of improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all specialized analyses are complete THEN the system SHALL consolidate findings from architecture, security, performance, and maintainability reviews
2. WHEN prioritizing improvements THEN the system SHALL consider business impact, implementation effort, and risk factors
3. WHEN creating the improvement plan THEN the system SHALL group related changes into logical phases
4. WHEN documenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide clear justification for each proposed change
5. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL categorize improvements as quick wins, medium effort, or major initiatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team, I want systematic implementation of approved improvements with proper documentation and testing, so that changes are applied safely without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing improvements THEN the system SHALL make changes progressively in small, reviewable increments
2. WHEN modifying code THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality
3. WHEN applying refactors THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency across similar patterns throughout the codebase
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL update relevant documentation and comments
5. WHEN completing modifications THEN the system SHALL verify that existing tests still pass and add new tests where appropriate
6. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths and deprecation notices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of all improvements, so that I can ensure the system maintains reliability and meets quality standards after changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improvements are implemented THEN the system SHALL run all existing tests to verify no regressions
2. WHEN code is modified THEN the system SHALL validate that coding standards and style guidelines are maintained
3. WHEN architecture changes are made THEN the system SHALL verify that service contracts and API compatibility are preserved
4. WHEN security improvements are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that security measures are properly implemented
5. WHEN performance optimizations are completed THEN the system SHALL provide measurable improvements in relevant metrics
