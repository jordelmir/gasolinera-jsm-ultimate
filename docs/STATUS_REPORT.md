## Project Status Report

### Step 1: Inventory and Audit

**Progress:** Blocked (approximately 50% complete for this step)

**Blocking Issue:**

The `make build-all` and `make dev` commands consistently fail with the following error:

```
keychain cannot be accessed because the current session does not allow user interaction. The keychain may be locked; unlock it by running "security -v unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" and try again
```

**Reason:**
This error indicates a problem with Docker's credential helper on macOS, which is unable to access the user's keychain in a non-interactive environment. This is an environment-specific configuration issue that requires manual intervention (e.g., unlocking the keychain, reconfiguring Docker's credential helper, or providing credentials interactively).

**Impact:**
I am unable to build Docker images or start the development environment. This prevents me from:
*   Further auditing the running services (e.g., verifying health endpoints, observing logs).
*   Proceeding with subsequent steps of the project, such as normalising environments, implementing quality and security measures, or setting up CI/CD.

**Required User Action:**
To unblock the project, the user needs to manually resolve the Docker keychain access issue on their macOS system. Once this is done, I can re-attempt the `make build-all` and `make dev` commands and continue with the project.

**Next Steps (once unblocked):**
1.  Re-attempt `make build-all` and `make dev`.
2.  If successful, proceed with further auditing (e.g., verifying health endpoints, observing logs).
3.  Create `fix/*` PRs for any compilation or runtime issues identified.
4.  Update this status report with the progress.
